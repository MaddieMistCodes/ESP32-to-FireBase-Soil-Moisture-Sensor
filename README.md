# ESP32-to-FireBase-Soil-Moisture-Sensor
This is an IoT project that incorporates electronic devices, real-time databases, networking and coding. In my project I use an ESP32 as my microcontroller to detect the soil moisture of my plant. This data is then transmitted over my home router to a Firebase RTDB. Finally, my kotlin app reads the data from the RTDB.
